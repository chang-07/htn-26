# DoorDash Menu Extraction

## Purpose

Given a DoorDash restaurant URL or a `(restaurant name, city)` pair, return the full menu — every category, every item, with name, price (string + float), description, popular/featured tags, and category section header. Also returns top-level restaurant metadata (canonical name, address line if visible, star rating, store-level URL). Read-only: never adds anything to a cart, never clicks "Add", never starts a checkout, never types payment details.

## When to Use

- Building a menu index across a chain (Chipotle, Sweetgreen, etc.) — hit the chain-level `/business/{slug}-{businessId}/menu` URL once per brand.
- Capturing per-store pricing where it varies by location (DashPass member pricing, surge-day surcharges, holiday menus) — the store-scoped `/store/...` URL is required.
- Snapshotting a menu for a price-tracking, allergen-tracking, or dietary-search downstream consumer.
- Comparing menus across locations of the same chain (use the chain `/business/...` URL for the canonical template, then sample a few `/store/...` URLs for delivery-price deltas).

## Workflow

DoorDash exposes **two parallel URL surfaces** for the same restaurant menu, with very different anti-bot postures. **Always check which surface fits the request first** — the chain `/business/` URL is ~100× cheaper and bypasses the Cloudflare challenge entirely, but it only exists for chain brands and serves the brand's *template* menu rather than store-specific pricing.

```
/store/{slug}-{storeId}/                       → store-specific, Cloudflare-challenged
/business/{slug}-{businessId}/menu             → chain-level, SSR'd HTML, no challenge
page-service.doordash.com/en-US/store/...      → underlying SSR layer (same HTML body)
```

### Step 1 — Decide the surface

| Scenario | Surface |
|---|---|
| Input is a `/store/{slug}-{id}/` URL with a *specific store* id | Browser (`/store/...`) — Step 4 |
| Input is a `/business/{slug}-{id}/` URL (chain hub) | Direct fetch (`/business/.../menu`) — Step 2 |
| Input is a chain restaurant name + city, and per-store pricing is **not** required | Direct fetch (resolve chain businessId via Step 3, then Step 2) |
| Input is a chain name + city, and per-store pricing **is** required (DashPass, geo-specific items) | Browser (`/store/...`) — Step 4 |
| Input is an independent (non-chain) restaurant | Browser (`/store/...`) — Step 4. Independents rarely have a `/business/` hub; verify via Step 3 search first. |

### Step 2 — Fast path: chain menu via `/business/.../menu`

```bash
browse cloud fetch "https://www.doordash.com/business/{slug}-{businessId}/menu" --allow-redirects --output menu.html
```

Returns SSR'd HTML, status 200, **no Cloudflare challenge** (verified across multiple business URLs on 2026-05-15). No `--proxies` flag is needed and adding `--verified` is not supported by `browse cloud fetch` anyway.

**Caveat — 1 MB Fetch API ceiling.** Business menu HTML is typically 1.0–1.5 MB. `browse cloud fetch` errors with `502 The response body exceeded the maximum allowed size of 1MB` on most production restaurants. Two workarounds:

1. **Browserbase session + `Page.getResourceContent`** — open the URL in a `browse cloud sessions create` session (no Verified/proxy needed for `/business/.../menu`), then read the response body via CDP. The 1 MB limit is `browse cloud fetch`-only; full sessions stream the whole document.
2. **Run the fetch in a Browserbase Function** (`browse cloud functions ...`). The function executes inside Browserbase's network, returns whatever JSON you serialize, and is not subject to the Fetch API's 1 MB cap.

Once you have the HTML, extract from one of three embedded sources (in order of preference):

- **`<script type="application/ld+json">` Schema.org `Restaurant` / `Menu`** — DoorDash emits structured-data JSON-LD for the menu sections and items, including `hasMenuSection[]`, `hasMenuItem[]`, `name`, `description`, `offers.price`, `offers.priceCurrency`. This is the cleanest extraction surface.
- **`<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">`** — the Next.js page-data blob containing the full hydration tree. Menu data lives under `props.pageProps.<...>.menu.categories[].items[]`. Schema changes occasionally; always parse defensively.
- **HTML scrape (last resort)** — `<h2 data-anchor-id="MenuItem-{itemId}">`, `<span data-anchor-id="MenuItem-Price">`, category headers as `<h2>` inside `<div data-anchor-id="StoreMenuList">`. Fragile across redesigns.

### Step 3 — Resolve a restaurant name → business or store ID

If the caller passes a name + city instead of a URL:

```bash
# Search the public sitemap index for a chain hub
browse cloud fetch "https://www.doordash.com/sitemap-business-doordash-index.xml" --output biz_idx.xml
# Pick the sharded sitemap, then grep for the slug
browse cloud fetch "https://cdn.doordash.com/sitemaps/sitemaps/sitemap-doordash-0-business-menu.xml" --output biz_smm.xml
grep -oE "/business/{slug-pattern}-[0-9]+/menu" biz_smm.xml | head -1
```

Or use `browse cloud search "site:doordash.com/business {restaurant name} menu"` — fast, returns canonical URL directly. Verified working in trace 2026-05-15 (returned `/business/chipotle-mexican-grill-115/` as top hit for "chipotle").

If no `/business/` page exists, the restaurant is an independent — fall through to Step 4 with the `/store/` URL discovered via `browse cloud search "site:doordash.com/store {name} {city}"`.

### Step 4 — Browser fallback for `/store/...` (store-specific or independent)

The `/store/{slug}-{storeId}/` URL is Cloudflare-protected with a **managed challenge** (`cType: 'managed'`, `cZone: 'www.doordash.com'`). Cleared 6 KB interstitial HTML on every bare fetch attempt observed on 2026-05-15 with and without `--proxies`. Requires a full headless browser with Verified + residential proxies to render.

```bash
SID=$(browse cloud sessions create --keep-alive --verified --proxies | jq -r '.id')
browse cloud browse env remote
browse cloud browse --connect "$SID" open "https://www.doordash.com/store/{slug}-{storeId}/"
browse cloud browse --connect "$SID" wait load
browse cloud browse --connect "$SID" wait timeout 4000   # Cloudflare JS challenge + menu hydration
```

**Cloudflare challenge:** With `--verified --proxies`, the managed challenge typically auto-solves in 3–6 s. If it does not clear, wait an additional 5 s and check `browse cloud browse get url`; a stuck challenge keeps `?__cf_chl_tk=...` in the URL.

**Address gate:** First store visit in a fresh session pops a "Set delivery address" modal that blocks the menu DOM. Two strategies:

1. **Skip via URL** — append `?pickup=true` to load the pickup variant. Pickup pricing usually matches delivery and there is no address gate.
2. **Fill the modal** — `browse cloud browse fill "input[placeholder='Address']" "{city}, {state}"`, wait 2 s for autocomplete dropdown, click the first suggestion `menuitem`, click `button: Save`. The session cookie persists for subsequent stores in the same `bb` session.

**Lazy-rendered categories:** DoorDash uses an IntersectionObserver to render category sections as the user scrolls. After the menu DOM mounts:

```bash
# Scroll to bottom in steps to trigger all categories
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6; do
  browse cloud browse --connect "$SID" scroll 640 360 0 1200
  browse cloud browse --connect "$SID" wait timeout 500
done
browse cloud browse --connect "$SID" snapshot
```

**Extract from the snapshot:** Each menu item appears as `region: MenuItem-{itemId}` with child text refs for name, price, description. Tag badges (`Popular`, `Featured`, `#1 Most Liked`) appear as sibling `image` or `text` refs inside the same region — look for the exact strings, they are not in `data-` attributes.

**Per-store JSON shortcut:** The page makes a hydration POST to `/graphql/storeMenu` (operation `storeMenu` or `storepageFeed`) carrying the storeId. Reading the response body via `browser-trace` CDP capture is the cleanest extraction — but you must capture during the page load, not after, and the GraphQL endpoint requires page-context cookies (no out-of-band call works — verified, 401 `authorization_invalid` from a cookieless POST to `https://consumer-mobile-bff.doordash.com/v3/stores/{id}/`).

### Step 5 — Release the session

```bash
browse cloud sessions update "$SID" --status REQUEST_RELEASE
```

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **READ-ONLY.** Never click the "Add to cart" or "+" buttons under each menu item. Never proceed to checkout. Stop at the menu snapshot.
- **Cloudflare managed challenge on `/store/...`** — every `/store/` URL returns a 6 KB interstitial (`<title>Just a moment...</title>`, `cType: 'managed'`, `cZone: 'www.doordash.com'`) on cookieless requests. `browse cloud fetch --proxies` does **not** clear it; only a JS-executing browser with `--verified --proxies` does. Verified 2026-05-15 across multiple stores and with/without proxies.
- **`/business/{slug}-{businessId}/menu` is the SEO-friendly SSR path** — fully indexed in `https://www.doordash.com/sitemap-business_menu-doordash-index.xml` (5 sharded sitemaps under `cdn.doordash.com/sitemaps/`), returns 200 OK without Cloudflare challenge. This is the fastest known way to extract a chain's menu.
- **`page-service.doordash.com` is the underlying SSR layer** — `https://page-service.doordash.com/en-US/store/{slug}-{id}/` serves the same SSR'd HTML body that the public `/business/` URL renders. Both paths exceed the 1 MB Fetch API ceiling, so direct `browse cloud fetch` is impractical without one of the workarounds in Step 2.
- **Two ID schemes, do not confuse them.** `/business/chipotle-mexican-grill-115/` uses business-id 115 (one per chain brand). `/store/chipotle-mexican-grill-san-francisco-303528/` uses store-id 303528 (one per physical location). They are not interchangeable.
- **Store URLs sometimes have a double-id form** — `/store/chipotle-mexican-grill-washington-270882/471923/`. The first id is the address/location group; the second is the actual store. Both forms route to the same store page.
- **Consumer-mobile-bff API requires JWT auth.** `https://consumer-mobile-bff.doordash.com/v3/stores/{id}/` and `/v1/stores/{id}/menu` return `401 {"name":"authorization_invalid","message":"Access Denied"}` from cookieless requests. Fingerprintable via `X-Shortened-Url-Path: v1-stores-id` header. Don't waste time on the BFF without a refresh token — the Identity service at `identity.doordash.com/auth/token/refresh` rate-limits and responds 403 to bare callers.
- **Address gate on first store visit.** The first `/store/` load in a fresh session always prompts for a delivery address. Bypass with `?pickup=true` or fill the modal once and reuse the session cookie via `--keep-alive`.
- **Categories are IntersectionObserver-lazy.** Scrolling is required to mount the full menu DOM — six 1200 px scrolls with a 500 ms wait between covers the longest menus observed. Don't rely on a single `snapshot` after `wait load`.
- **Tag badges live in DOM text, not attributes.** `Popular`, `Featured`, `#1 Most Liked`, `Customer Favorite` appear as sibling spans/images inside the item region, not as `data-tag` attributes. Match the exact strings.
- **Asterisks / price suffixes.** Some items display "$13.65*" or "$13.65+" — `*` indicates "starting at" for items with required modifiers, `+` indicates a base price with optional add-ons. Strip when emitting `price_float`, preserve in `price` (string), and flag with `flags: ["base_price"]`.
- **Sold-out items render with a strikethrough.** They have an `aria-disabled="true"` attribute on the item region. Emit them as `{ available: false }` rather than silently dropping — the caller may need the snapshot for a price database.
- **Regional locale prefixes** — `/en-CA/...`, `/en-AU/...`, `/en-NZ/...`, `/en-GB/...` and `/fr-CA/...` exist. The default `www.doordash.com/` (no locale) serves US. International stores show currency-localized prices; preserve the currency code from `offers.priceCurrency` in the JSON-LD or `__NEXT_DATA__`.
- **`m.doordash.com` returns 500** — there is no usable mobile-web subdomain. Don't waste time probing it.
- **`browse cloud fetch` 1 MB ceiling** — DoorDash store and business HTML routinely exceeds 1 MB. The Fetch API errors with `502 The response body exceeded the maximum allowed size of 1MB`. Use a real session for any full-page extraction, or run the fetch inside a Browserbase Function where the limit does not apply.
- **CDP egress restriction on some sandbox tenants.** During skill development on 2026-05-15 the runtime sandbox could resolve `api.browserbase.com` (REST API for sessions/fetch/search) but **not** `connect.usw2.browserbase.com` (WSS CDP endpoint), which made live `browse cloud browse --connect` and the autobrowse evaluator unreachable from that sandbox. If a future caller hits the same DNS REFUSED on `connect.{region}.browserbase.com`, run the browser portion from a host with unrestricted egress; the API-only paths (Steps 2, 3) work fine from a restricted sandbox.
- **Cloudflare `__cf_bm` cookie persistence.** Once a Verified session clears the challenge, the `__cf_bm` cookie (path `/`, domain `doordash.com` and `www.doordash.com`, ~30 min expiry) carries it across `/store/...` navigations. Keep the session alive (`--keep-alive`) and reuse it for batch extraction across stores in the same brand.
